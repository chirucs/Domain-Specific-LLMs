## Overview
Generative AI has made significant strides in tackling specialized problems by fine-tuning foundation models like PaLM and Gemini for specific domains. This project focuses on two primary areas:
1. **Cybersecurity**: Using security-focused models (SecLM) to automate threat detection, triage, and incident response.
2. **Healthcare**: Employing medical models (MedLM) to assist in clinical decision-making, medical Q&A, and patient interaction.

## Notebooks
1. **`fine-tuning-a-custom-model.ipynb`**: Demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a foundation model for a domain-specific task, highlighting key techniques like parameter-efficient tuning and in-context learning.
2. **`google-search-grounding.ipynb`**: Explores grounding model outputs in real-time data using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance relevance and reduce hallucinations.

## Key Concepts
- **Foundation Models**: Pre-trained LLMs adapted for specific use cases through fine-tuning and specialized data.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Integrating external knowledge sources to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting prompts to guide model behavior effectively, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and cybersecurity.
